<h3> Controller </h3>
<span>? In an Express.js application, a "controller" refers to a part of your code that is responsible for handling the application's logic. Controllers are typically used to process incoming requests, interact with models (data sources), and send responses back to clients. They help organize your application by separating concerns and following the MVC (Model-View-Controller) design pattern.,</span>

<h3>Router </h3>
<span>? In Express.js, express.Router() is a mini Express application without all the server configurations but with the ability to define routes, middleware, and even have its own set of route handlers. It allows you to modularize your routes and middleware to keep your code organized and maintainable.
* <https://expressjs.com/en/guide/routing.html>
 Use the express.Router class to create modular, mountable route handlers. A Router instance is a complete middleware and routing system; for this reason, it is often referred to as a “mini-app”.
